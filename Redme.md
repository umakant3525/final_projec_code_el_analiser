## Solar Panel Detection Project

### ⚠️ Note:
The model files (`*.pt`) and virtual environment (`venv/`) are **not included** in this repo.

To run the project:
1. Download the model weights and place them in the root directory:
   - `yolo.pt`
   - `good_bad_model2.pt`
   - etc.

2. Create a virtual environment:
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
